Crop_types: The types of crops we grow. David
    crop_id: INT, auto_increment, unique, not NULL, PK
    crop_name: VARCHAR, not NULL, unique


Rows: Growers can enter newly planted Rows of crops. David
    row_id: INT, auto_increment, unique, not NULL, PK
    crop_id: VARCHAR, not NULL, FK
    mature_date: DATE, not NULL
    Relationship: a 1:M relationship between Crop_types and Rows is implemented with crop_id as a FK inside of Rows


Harvests: Used to track what produce is on handâ€“quantity is deducted when added to Box_Harvests by our algorithm. David
    harvest_id: INT, auto_increment, unique, not NULL, PK
    row_id: INT, not NULL, FK
    harvest_date: DATE, not NULL
    expiration_date: DATE, not NULL
    quantity: INT, not NULL
    Relationship: a 1:1 relationship between Rows and Harvests is implemented with row_id AND crop_id as a FK inside of Harvests


Boxes: Each week of the year has a box associated with it. Amelia
    box_id: INT, PK, auto_increment
    box_date: DATE, not NULL


Boxes_Harvests: An intersection table used to track produce going into each weekly box. David
    harvest_id: FK, indicates that a harvested crop is in a box (quantity per week generated automatically by algorithm based on quantity and time between harvest_date and expiration_date)
    box_id: FK, indicates the particular box that a harvest crop will be in
    Relationship: a 1:M relationship between Boxes_Harvests and Boxes, with box_id as a FK inside Boxes_Harvests
    Relationship: a 1:M relationship between Boxes_Harvests and Harvests, with harvest_id as a FK inside Boxes_Harvests


Customers: Tracks customers and how long they have paid for Boxes. Amelia
    customer_id: INT, auto_increment, unique, not NULL, PK
    first_name: VARCHAR, not NULL
    last_name: VARCHAR, not NULL
    date_paid: DATE, not NULL


Boxes_Customers: An intersection table used to track which customers get which boxes. Amelia
    box_id: FK
    customer_id: FK
    Relationship: a 1:M relationship between Boxes_Customers and Boxes, with box_id as a FK inside Boxes_Customers
    Relationship: a 1:M relationship between Boxes_Customers and Customers, with customer_id as a FK inside Boxes_Customers
